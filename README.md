# Chemistry-Chemical-Equation-Balancer
Balance Chemical equations and Calculate relative molecular masses of Molecular and Ionic Formulas

e.g.

./molcalc NaCl 

result: NaCl has a relative molar mass of :  58.442669280000004 grams

./chemicalequationbalancer
please input your reactants, this is case sensitive
your input should look like: H2O+Ag3(Fe3O)4
Reactants: N2 + O2
please input your products, this is case sensitive
Products: N2O2
1N2 + 1O2 -> 1N2O2
